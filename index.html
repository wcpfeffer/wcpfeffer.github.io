<a id="voip--instant-messenger" class="anchor" href="#voip--instant-messenger" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>VoIP &amp; Instant Messenger</h3>

<hr>

<p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Java, JavaFX, CSS</p>

<p>This is a personal project that started from a general interest in developing an instant messaging system when I first started programming. This project has gone through many iteration, changing languages a few times. It started as a C# client, and was later ported to Java to support a wider variety of systems.  </p>

<p>This is an audio and text based communication system. This project uses a client/server architecture, and gave me experience with networking, multi-threading, and porting from C# to Java.</p>

<p>Implemented: </p>

<ul>
<li>JavaFX User Interface</li>
<li>Peer to Peer calling (via UDP hole-punching)</li>
<li>Encryption</li>
<li>Instant Messaging</li>
<li>MySQL Database</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Java</p>

<p>This tool aims to reconstruct data provenance records through semantic analysis of documents. It focuses on news article provenance links and provenance links between files in git repositories. </p>

<p>A continuation of work done by graduate students, I improved the reconstruction process by improving the foundational code, and implementing semantic analysis techniques such as cosine similarity. </p>

<p>Developed a GUI and two automation tools to collect datasets to test the reconstruction process.</p>

<a id="book-store" class="anchor" href="#book-store" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Book Store</h3>

<hr>

<p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Java, JSP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</p>

<p>This website was part of my web programming class project. We were tasked to create a fully functional (minus payments) website that allowed browsing/purchasing/buying books. This project was restricted to only using Java/JSP/JavaScript/CSS/HTML. This gave me experience with back end web development techniques, front end development, and site design.</p>

<p>Implemented (front &amp; back end): </p>

<ul>
<li>Product Page </li>
<li>Browsing Page </li>
<li>Account Page </li>
<li>Admin Pages &amp; Functionality</li>
<li>Buying Functionality</li>
<li>Searching Functionality</li>
<li>Cart Functionality </li>
<li>Product Reviews</li>
<li>Database design/implementation. </li>
<li>Site design.</li>
</ul>

<a id="traceit" class="anchor" href="#traceit" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TraceIt</h3>

<hr>

<p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Java</p>

<p>TraceIt is an android game that challenges users to trace shapes in a short time window. This was a game developed for my modern software development class, and gave me experience working with mobile development.</p>

<p>I was responsible for the polygon creation and randomization process. I also helped collaborate on various issues and design decisions. </p>

<h3>
<a id="changetrac" class="anchor" href="#changetrac" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ChangeTrac</h3>

<hr>

<p><strong>Technologies:</strong> C#</p>

<p>ChangeTrac is a research tool developed to capture changes made to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. I was responsible for adding additional features, collecting user feedback, and revising the tool based on the feedback received. </p>

<p>I also implemented a multi-cell tracking technique that allowed tracking changes over multiple cells at the same time, and was responsible for refactoring the entire code base.</p>
