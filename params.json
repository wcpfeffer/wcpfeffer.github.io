{"name":"William C. Pfeffer","tagline":"Project Porfolio","body":"\r\n***\r\n### Purpose\r\n***\r\nThis is a site put together to showcase some of the projects that I have worked on over the years. This is an expanded view of my LinkedIn profile and the descriptions found on that page.\r\n\r\n### VoIP & Instant Messenger\r\n***\r\n**Technologies:** Java, JavaFX, CSS\r\n\r\nThis is a personal project that started from a general interest in developing an instant messaging system when I first started programming. This project has gone through many iteration, changing languages a few times. It started as a C# client, and was later ported to Java to support a wider variety of systems.  \r\n\r\nThis is an audio and text based communication system. This project uses a client/server architecture, and gave me experience with networking, multi-threading, and porting from C# to Java.\r\n\r\nImplemented: \r\n+ JavaFX User Interface\r\n+ Peer to Peer calling (via UDP hole-punching)\r\n+ Encryption\r\n+ Instant Messaging\r\n+ MySQL Database\r\n\r\nCo-Dev: Nathan Duncan\r\n\r\n### Data Provenance Reconstruction \r\n***\r\n**Technologies:** Java\r\n\r\nThis tool aims to reconstruct data provenance records through semantic analysis of documents. It focuses on news article provenance links and provenance links between files in git repositories. \r\n\r\nA continuation of work done by graduate students, I improved the reconstruction process by improving the foundational code, and implementing semantic analysis techniques such as cosine similarity. \r\n\r\nDeveloped a GUI and two automation tools to collect datasets to test the reconstruction process.\r\n\r\n### Book Store\r\n***\r\n**Technologies:** Java, JSP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS\r\n\r\nThis website was part of my web programming class project. We were tasked to create a fully functional (minus payments) website that allowed browsing/purchasing/buying books. This project was restricted to only using Java/JSP/JavaScript/CSS/HTML. This gave me experience with back end web development techniques, front end development, and site design.\r\n\r\nImplemented (front & back end): \r\n+ Product Page \r\n+ Browsing Page \r\n+ Account Page \r\n+ Admin Pages & Functionality\r\n+ Buying Functionality\r\n+ Searching Functionality\r\n+ Cart Functionality \r\n+ Product Reviews\r\n+ Database design/implementation. \r\n+ Site design.\r\n\r\n### TraceIt\r\n***\r\n**Technologies:** Java\r\n\r\nTraceIt is an android game that challenges users to trace shapes in a short time window. This was a game developed for my modern software development class, and gave me experience working with mobile development.\r\n\r\nI was responsible for the polygon creation and randomization process. I also helped collaborate on various issues and design decisions. \r\n\r\n### ChangeTrac\r\n***\r\n**Technologies:** C#\r\n\r\nChangeTrac is a research tool developed to capture changes made to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. I was responsible for adding additional features, collecting user feedback, and revising the tool based on the feedback received. \r\n\r\nI also implemented a multi-cell tracking technique that allowed tracking changes over multiple cells at the same time, and was responsible for refactoring the entire code base.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
